# todoApp-ensolvers-challenge

Welcome! this is a to-do app where you can read, create, delete and update tasks.   
In order to test this app you wont need anything preinstalled, just a browser, access
to internet and enter   
to this link:
[Heroku Deploy](https://spring-angular-todoapp.herokuapp.com/)

Please be patient if the app doesnt start immediately, i used the free tier available 
at Heroku and it turns off after 30 minutes if nobody uses it.  
(sometimes you might have to refresh the page a few times to get it to work properly)

## Technologies used in this app:
- Frontend
  - Angular 12.2
    - ng-bootstrap
  - Angular CLI 12.2.10
  - TypeScript 4.3.5
  - Node 14.15.1
  - Bootstrap 5.1
  
- Backend
  - Java 8
  - Spring Boot 2.6
    - Lombok
    - JPA
    - MySQL Conector
  - Maven 3.8.2
  - MySQL 8.0.26

## Aclarations

Although this works, maybe using Docker could have been a better approach in this situation to make it more portable,
run it on any environment and run it with one single command.
